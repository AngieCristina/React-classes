# React-classes
This code is about component classes and component instances, also React.Component, like how to import, and how to render a component instance. :)  I have been introduced to you some common ways of using JSX in React components. I have rendered components using multiline JSX expressions, logic inside of the render function, a conditional statement, this, and an event listener.
